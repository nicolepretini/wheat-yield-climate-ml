# Wheat Yield Prediction from Climate Data

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between climate variables and wheat yield
using historical country-level data. The objective is to build reproducible
machine learning models to predict yield and analyze key climate drivers.

## Motivation
Climate variability strongly impacts crop productivity. Accurate yield prediction
can support decision-making in agriculture, food security, and commodity markets.

## Data Sources
- FAOSTAT: wheat yield data
- Public climate datasets (temperature and precipitation indicators)

## Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Regression and machine learning models
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Status
🚧 In progress
